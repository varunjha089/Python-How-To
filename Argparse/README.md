# Argparse Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to be a gentle introduction to *`argparse`*, the recommended command-line parsing module in the Python standard Library.

There are two other modules that fulfill the task
- **`getopt`** :- an equivalent for **`getopt()`** from the C Programming Language
- **`optparse`** :- is a deprecated module. **`Argparse`** is based on **`optparse`**, and is similar in use.
